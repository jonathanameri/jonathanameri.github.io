    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Front-End Tech</h3>
    <p>
        For this application, I recommend using the React and React Native frameworks for the front-end. React Native is ideal 
        for this project because the client is looking for an application that works on both iOS and Android devices, as well as the web. 
        With React Native, our development team can write code once and publish the application for multiple platforms. In addition, React is 
        the most popular JavaScript framework, so there is an abundance of documentation and additional libraries available online. I also suggest
        using the Expo library, which provides us with access to pre-made React Native components for features such as using the device's camera, local 
        storage, and the device's geolocation data. This is essential for the native versions of our app, but would also give us the option to implement
        all features of the app for the web version. Since the client is looking to track images and the location of the POI, being able to take pictures
        and track location data from the device is necessary. To handle offline usage for the researchers, I recommend utilizing the local storage 
        of a researchers device through Expo components to store data about a POI, and have the app make interval connection requests to the backend 
        to eventually permanently store the data. This will ensure that in the case that a researcher loses internet connection, the 
        data they collect while offline will still make it to our backend.
    </p>
    <h3>Mapping</h3>
    <p>
        To cover mapping for this project, I suggest that the DXG uses Mapbox. They offer a JavaScript library called 'Mapbox GL JS' which allows 
        for integration of maps into React apps. This would be the easiest and fastest way to develop a map that can display our stored geolocation
        data points as points of interest, as well as the additional description of each point. Mapbox offers an abundance of helpful 
        documentation on their website to assist with the development process. Using MapBox GL, the only data required
        to place markers on a map are the latitude/longitude values for each point of interest. Mapbox would allow us to make the markers clickable so that we 
        can present the additional information from the researchers for each point. Additionally, since the DXG has already used Mapbox, our 
        development team would be familiar with the required API calls, and have no issue with integrating it into this project.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Back-End Tech</h3>
    <p>
        For this project, I suggest that we use Supabase as our backend. Supabase is a Backend as a Service (BaaS), which means we would not have to create
        our own backend. Rather, supabase gives us access to a PostgreSQL database, file storage, and user management. For a smaller project like this 
        one, where there is only 5 or so users with access to update the database, we don't need necessarily the most robust and efficient backend. The free version of
        supabase would likely suffice, helping us save on costs, while not sacrificing functionality. If the project were to be scaled up, Supabase would allow us 
        to easily increase capacity for an increase in monthly charges. Supabase gives us the full functionality required for a backend for this project, including authentication 
        and file storage. Using supabase's authentication service, we can easily create and manage logins for the researchers, and ensure that only 
        users with permission are allowed to directly access the database. Supabase also automatically generates API calls that you can use within your app based on the database
        as it changes, which would help speed up the development workflow. When it comes to the database itself, we could either store latitude/longitude as
        floating points, or we could utilize a PostgreSQL library such as PostGIS, which has data types specifically for precise locations.
    </p>
    <h3>Hosting for web</h3>
    <p>
        I suggest that we host the app using a service such as Firebase. Since we are not developing our own backend, it would make sense to use one of many
        hosting services available online. Firebase is a great option because it makes deploying an application extremely easy at low cost. For a small project
        such as this, the free version of Firebase would suffice. If the user-base became too large for the free version of Firebase, we 
        could easily scale up by switching to the premium version of Firebase. Firebase has been around since 2012, and has built a reputation
        of being a reliable way of deploying your application to the web.
