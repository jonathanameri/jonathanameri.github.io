    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Front-End Tech</h3>
    <p>
        For this application, I recommend using the React and React Native frameworks for the front-end. React Native is ideal 
        for this project because the client is looking for an application that works on both iOS and Android devices, as well as the web. 
        With React Native, our development team can write code once and publish the application for multiple platforms. In addition, React is 
        the most popular JavaScript framework, so there is an abundance of documentation and additional libraries available online. I also suggest
        using the Expo library, which provides us with access to pre-made React components for features such as using the device's camera, local 
        storage, and the device's geolocation data. Since the client is looking to track images and the location of the POI, being able to build
        these features is necessary. To handle offline usage for the researchers, I recommend using the local storage of a researchers device 
        to store data about a POI, and have the app make interval connection requests to the backend to eventually permanently store the data. 
        This will ensure that in the case that a researcher loses internet connection, the data they collect while offline will make it to 
        our backend.
    </p>
    <h3>Mapping</h3>
    <p>
        For mapping, I suggest that the DXG uses Mapbox for this project. They offer a JavaScript library called 'Mapbox GL JS' which allows 
        for integration of maps into React apps. This would be the easiest and fastest way to develop a map that can display our stored geolocation
        data points as points of interest, as well as the additional description of each point. Mapbox is a well known service, so it has a ton 
        of documentation on their site which would aid the development process. Additionally, since the DXG has already used Mapbox, our 
        development team would have no issue with using it for this project.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Back-End Tech</h3>
    <p>
        For this project, I suggest that we use Supabase as our backend. Supabase is a Backend as a Service (BaaS), which means we would not have to create
        our own backend. Rather, supabase gives us access to a PostgreSQL database, file storage, and user management. For a smaller project like this 
        one, where there is only 5 or so users with access to update the database, we don't need necessarily the most robust and efficient backend. The free version of
        supabase would likely suffice, helping us save on costs, while not sacrificing functionality. If the project were to be scaled up, Supabase would allow us 
        to easily increase capacity for an increase in monthly charges. Supabase gives us the functionality required for this project, including authentication 
        and file storage. Using supabase's authentication service, we can easily create and manage logins for the researchers, and ensure that only 
        users with permission are allowed to directly access the database. Supabase also automatically generates API calls that you can use within your app based on the database
        as it changes, which would help speed up the development workflow.
    </p>
    <h3>Hosting</h3>
    <p>
        I suggest that we host the app using a service such as Firebase. Since we are not developing our own backend, it would make sense to use one of many
        hosting services available online. Firebase is a great option because it makes deploying an application extremely easy at low cost. For a small project
        such as this, the free version of Firebase would suffice.
